## Thinking of Software in terms of Components

- We are familiar with buying things online
- we are  not surprised when the goods land up at our door step
- behind this there is a huge system
    - vendor
    - logistic person

- how was amazon built, in a monolithic way, or in a component way?
    - monolothic means everything is in one place and one system
    - component means, there are different components, which are working together to make the system work.

- At the start we might not know what are all the features that is needed, but we can start with some features and then add more features as we go along.
- Team will be divided into manageable parts
- Each team will be responsible for a component
- everyone need not know the working of all the component,
- but they should know how to interact with other components.
