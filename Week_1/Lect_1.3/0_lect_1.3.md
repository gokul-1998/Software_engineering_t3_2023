- Need to understand what problem we need to solve,

- Ultimately the software components will be used by different types of users, known as clients
- we need to ensure that the requiremnts cater to their needs

- Who is a client?
    - end user?
    - or someone who comes to buy?
- client could be internal users also,one component could be used by another component.so the client could be another component.
